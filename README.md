# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Objetive of this script

run_analysis.R does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### Files used

For the purpose of this project, the files in the Inertial Signals folders were not used. The files that were used to load data are listed below:

* test/subject_test.txt
* test/X_test.txt
* test/y_test.txt
* train/subject_train.txt
* train/X_train.txt
* train/y_train.txt

## How to run:

To make this script run just download the file in your R working directory. One time ran, the script automates all tasks.
